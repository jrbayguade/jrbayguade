# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Jesus!

I'm a programmer at heart, entrepreneur by experience, and currently General Manager at [Product Madness](https://www.productmadness.com/), where I lead a large international team in the mobile gaming industry. Years ago, I founded and escalated several tech companies, and sold a game development one, and now Iâ€™m diving deep into the world of data science.

ðŸŽ“ I'm currently studying a Bachelor's Degree in Data Science at **Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (UNIR)**, which keeps me *very* busy (and also very inspired). I'm especially interested in machine learning, AI, and predictive modeling to solve real-world problems.

## ðŸ§  What youâ€™ll find here

This GitHub is where I:
- Share personal data projects and experiments with AI and (sometimes) predictive models.
- Upload coursework and exercises related to my Data Science studies.
- Explore new technologies and tools that spark my curiosity.
- Occasionally participate in Kaggle competitions or other public data challenges.

## ðŸš€ Interests
- Statistics, Linear Algebra (and yeah why not, math in general)
- Artificial Intelligence
- Machine Learning
- Predictive Analytics
- Gaming & user behavior data
- Python, SQL, and data tooling
- Learning in general, and challenging myself
